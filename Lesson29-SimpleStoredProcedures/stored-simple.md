# Stored Procedure Exercise - Simple
**Stored Procedure must be the first statement in a batch, so place GO in between each question to execute the previous batch (question) and start another.** Use the IQSchool database.

## Exercise
1. Create a stored procedure called “HonorCourses” to select all the course names that have averages > 80%.<br>

```sql

```

2. Create a stored procedure called “HonorCoursesOneTerm” to select all the course names that have average > 80% in semester A100.<br>

```sql

```

3. Oops, made a mistake! For question 2, it should have been for semester A200. Write the code to change the procedure accordingly.<br>

```sql

```

4. Create a stored procedure called “NotInDMIT221” that lists the full names of the staff that have not taught DMIT221.<br>

```sql

```

5. Create a stored procedure called “LowNumbers” to select the course name of the course(s) that have had the lowest number of students in it. Assume all courses have registrations.<br>

```sql

```

6. Create a stored procedure called “Provinces” to list all the student’s provinces.<br>

```sql

```

7. OK, question 6 was ridiculously simple and serves no purpose. Let us remove that stored procedure from the database.<br>

```sql

```

8. Create a stored procedure called StudentPaymentTypes that lists all the student names and their payment type Description. Ensure all the student names are listed.<br>

```sql

```

9. Modify the procedure from question 8 to return only the student names that have made payments.<br>

```sql

```
